Q1. "Summarize simulation results - and any metrics you will use to compare the performance of one approach to another - in a table."

Q2. "Based on simulation results, what version of code performs best? Are there any speedups over the baseline and why do you think that this is/is not the case? 
Include an extended discussion and justify why you have made this decision using sumulation data from the parse_Stats script. Should be ~ 300 
words."
